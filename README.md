# Python-socket-server

This project sets up a simple TCP server and client for handling text analysis tasks. The server, implemented using Python's socketserver module, listens for incoming connections on localhost at port 8080. It defines a custom handler class MyTCPHandler to process client requests. The handler receives messages containing a command letter followed by a string of text. Depending on the command letter ('W' for word count, 'L' for lowercase count, 'U' for uppercase count, 'R' for numeric count, 'T' for total character count), the server calculates and returns the requested statistic. The client, implemented with a separate script, sends predefined messages to the server for analysis. Each message contains a command letter followed by a text string. Upon receiving the server's response, the client prints it out. Overall, this project demonstrates a basic client-server architecture for text analysis tasks over a TCP connection.
